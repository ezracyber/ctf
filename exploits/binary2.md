## Exploiting Binaries 2

In this module, we continue to examine the ways that native applications can be exploited and focus on using return-oriented programming \(ROP\) to achieve that goal. ROP is the process of stitching together existing executable fragments of code ending in a return instruction. By creating chains of addresses of these ‘gadgets’ one can write new programs without introducing any new code.

Keep in mind that you will need to be flexible in identifying methods to exploit programs. Sometimes it’s necessary to abuse a vulnerability multiple times in the course of an exploit. At times, you may only want to use a ROP bridge to make your shellcode executable and, at others, you may want to use a payload written entirely in ROP. Occasionally, the layout of memory makes unorthodox methods of exploitation favorable. For example, have you considered manufacturing an uncontrolled format string vulnerability using ROP?

## Lecture

In this lecture we will discuss return oriented programming \(ROP\) and code reuse to bypass protections that disallow the execution of attacker-provided data. These lectures go into much greater detail on exploitation and build upon some of what was discussed last week.

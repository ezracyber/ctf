# What to expect

All those who will manage to reach the final round  of cyberchallenge competition, will have advantages of not only meeting high profile tech companies in the country but also will have an opportunity in demostrate their skills on future project to follow after successfuly completion of the competition.

## Employers

As far as I can tell, there are five major employers in the infosec industry \(not counting academia\) in this campaign you can have opportunity to join .

* The Government
* Non-Tech big companies \(mostly finance\)
* Big Tech Vendors \(eg. mobile phone operators etc.\)
* Big Consulting \(mostly non-technical\)
* Small Consulting \(mostly awesome\)

The industry you will be work in will determine the major problems you have to solve. For example, the emphasis in finance is to reduce risk at the lowest cost to the business \(opportunities for large-scale automation\). On the other hand, consulting often means selling people on the idea that X is actually a vulnerability and researching to find new ones.

## Roles

I primarily split up infosec jobs into internal network security, product security, and consulting. I further break down these classes of jobs into the following roles:

* Application Security \(code audits/app assessments\)
* Attacker \(offensive\)
* Compliance
* Forensics
* Incident Handler
* Manager
* Network Security Engineer
* Penetration Tester
* Policy
* Researcher
* Reverse Engineer
* Security Architect

The roles above each require a different, highly specialized body of knowledge. This website is a great resource for application security and penetration testing, but you should find other resources if you are interested in a different role

## Capture the Flag

If you want to acquire and maintain technical skills and you want to do it fast, then you should play in a CTF or jump into a wargame. The one thing to note is that many of these challenges attach themselves to conferences \(of all sizes\), and by playing in them you will likely miss the entire rest of the conference. Try not to over do it, since conferences are useful in their own way \(see the rest of the career guide\).

There are some defense-only competitions that disguise themselves as normal CTF competitions, mainly the Collegiate Cyber Defense Challenge \(CCDC\) and its regional variations, and my opinion is that you should avoid them. They are exercises in system administration and frustration and will teach you little about security or anything else. They are incredibly fun to play as a Red Team though.

## Communication

In any role, the majority of your time will be spent communicating with others, primarily through email and meetings and less by phone and IM. The role/employer you have will determine whether you speak more with internal infosec teams, non-security technologists, or business users. For example, expect to communicate more with external technologists if you do network security for a financial firm.

Tips for communicating well in a large organization:

* Learn to write clear, concise, and professional email.
* Learn to get things done and stay organized. Do not drop the ball.
* Learn the business that your company or client is in. If you can speak in terms of the business, your arguments a\) to not do things b\) to fix things and c\) to do things that involve time and money will be much more persuasive.
* Learn how your company or client works, ie. key individuals, processes, or other motivators that factor into what gets things done.



### Meet People

After finishing this challenge, we expect you to have some friend along the way \(and we encourage that\) this is the best way to stay ahead with latest new and trend in cybersecurity industry, we have special forum for this.

### Confer

* [Information Security Conferences Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=pe2ikdbe6b841od6e26ato0asc@group.calendar.google.com)

If you go to a conference, don't obsess over attending a talk during every time slot. The talks are just bait to lure all the smart hackers to one location for a weekend: you should meet the other attendees! If a particular talk was interesting and useful then you can and should talk to the speaker. [This post](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-speakerscorner.html#idols-moyer) by Shawn Moyer at the Defcon Speaker's Corner has more on this subject.

If you're working somewhere and are having trouble justifying conference attendance to your company, the [Infosec Leaders blog](http://www.infosecleaders.com/2010/03/career-advice-tuesday-making-the-case-for-conference-attendance/) has some helpful advice.

## Certifications

This industry requires specialized knowledge and skills and studying for a certification exam will not help you gain them. In fact, in many cases, it can be harmful because the time you spend studying for a test will distract you from doing anything else in this guide.

That said, there are inexpensive and vendor-neutral certifications that you can reasonably obtain with your current level of experience to help set apart your resume, like the [Network+](http://certifications.comptia.org/getCertified/certifications/network.aspx) and [Security+](http://certification.comptia.org/getCertified/certifications/security.aspx) or even a [NOP](http://www.immunitysec.com/services-cnop.shtml), but I would worry about certifications the least in your job search or professional development.

In general, the two best reasons to get certifications are:

* If you are being paid to get certified, through paid training and exams or sometimes through an automatic pay raise after you get the certification \(common in the government\).
* If your company or your client is forcing you to get certified. This is usually to help with a sales pitch, ie. "You should hire us because all of our staff are XYZ certified!"

In general, it is far more productive to spend time playing in a CTF, then using your final standing as proof that you're capable.

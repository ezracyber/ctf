## How is a Wargame different?

Wargames are similar to a CTF but are always ongoing. Typically, they are organized into levels that get progressively harder as you solve more of them. Wargames are an excellent way to practice for CTF! Here are some of our favorites:

* [Micro Corruption](https://microcorruption.com/login)
* [SmashTheStack](http://www.smashthestack.org/)
* [OverTheWire](http://overthewire.org/wargames/)
